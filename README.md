**Nano with n8n** is an AI-powered automation workflow built using **n8n** and **OpenRouter (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview)**.  
It allows users to upload an image and provide text instructions to automatically edit or generate social-media-ready visuals.

The workflow includes:
- A **Form Trigger** for image and text input  
- **Base64 conversion** for file handling  
- **HTTP Request** to the OpenRouter API for AI-based image generation  
- **JSON extraction and conversion** back to a downloadable image  

This project simplifies creative editing by integrating automation with AI, enabling fast, clean, and professional visual outputs â€” ideal for creators, designers, and content editors.
